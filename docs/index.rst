Welcome to Research References Tracking Tool's documentation!
=============================================================

The Research References Tracking Tool (R2T2) aims to fill the last remaining gap into the circle of open research, enabling not just publications to cite data or software (still a work in progress), but also the latter to cite the research articles containing the theory it codes, or the datasets it uses.

Some of the benefits of using R2T2 in your project are:

- Facilitate giving credit to all the works software is based on.
- Promote those worksâ€™ visibility and impact.
- Promote the transparency of the code: bi-directional link between theory and the specific code that implements it.
- Facilitate code maintenance and improve its sustainability.
